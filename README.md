Ideas:
- Collection system
- Random chance
- Choose which direction to go in dungeon (doesn't make any difference)
- Randomly generates a monster (monsters have set HP and attack power and have different loot that can drop (also by chance))
- Battle against monster
- Hits can have different attack damage based on luck
- Can upgrade gear with money gained from kills or gain loot
- Weapons and armor automatically are slotted with best one

Monster Stats:
HP, Attack Damage, Loot, Attack Speed (mob attack/player attack)

Monsters:
- Zombie
  - 10, 1-3, $10-20, 1/1
- Vampire
  - 15, 2-5, $20-30, 1/1
- Witch
  - 15, 4-5, $20-35, 1/2
- Troll
  - 20, 4-6, $35-50, 1/2
- Sorcerer
  - 20, 5-7, $50-70, 1/3
- Giant
  - 30, 5-7, $50-70, 1/4

Player Stats:
HP, Attack Damage, Armor Points (all default)
10, 3-4, 5, 

NOTES:
Armor points add onto your health (ex: HP = 10, armor points = 10, total HP = 25)
Attack damage is diretly correlated to the weapon (if one weapon has 5, and you get a new one with 7 your attack damage will only be 7, not 12)
