Ideas:
- Collection system
- Random chance
- Choose which direction to go in dungeon (doesn't make any difference)
- Randomly generates a monster (monsters have set HP and attack power and have different loot that can drop (also by chance))
- Battle against monster
- Hits can have different attack damage based on luck
- Can upgrade gear with money gained from kills or gain loot
- Weapons and armor automatically are slotted with best one
